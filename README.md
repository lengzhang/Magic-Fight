# MagicFight by Leng Zhang

## Introduction
  For this custom lab project, I made a wizard fighting game. Two wizards stand both sides to use magic to attack each other by shooting power ball to each other or to opposite base after destroying opposite towers.

  For implementing this game, I used a ATMEGA 1284-PU microprocessor to control the system, a Nokia 5110 Graphic LCD 84Ã—48 to display the game, two shift registers to control 10 segment LED bar to display the remain time of the game, two Joysticks and a push button to control, and a slide switch to control the game on and off.
